2. Hope to get a fair amount of fluency turned in this week.

## May 30, 2019

1. Had a good team meeting. I taught about transitions. Easy stuff to teach and learn about. Don't over do it because it can be annoying to the user.
2. Had a lot of fun writing the ajax fluency. Ajax is one of my favorite javascript programs to write because you don't have to refresh the page to change the content. I am excited to learn more about React which does a lot of these things for you. 
3. Build out a better JSON object fluency should be able to pass with 10 on both these assignments.

1. Struggling with getting everything done. Selling my house has taken a lot of time prepping for it to be sold. Internship is also taking a lot of time to keep up and to get a full time position after I graduate. See how I can find time to finish all 13 assignments. 
2. Turned in 2 more fluency reports. They where not hard to accomplish. CSS is easy to manipulate with JS. Changing things with CSS is really simple to accomplish. 
3. Two last assignments to finish up. This week and get at least a basic.

1. Working on full CSS Animation, transitions, transforms. I think I did at least a basic or high level for the css on that assignment. Just takes a lot of time making the layout and writing what should happen. CSS is one of the easyest things. Super fun.
2. Group meeting went really well. Almost everyone is done with their fluency reports and started on their final project. I will be turning in the last CSS project tonight.
3. I have all the videos post for the group in the announcements. We are going to continue with our meetings to make sure everyone is well supported. I think this is smart to make sure nobody has any problems. We also get to showcase what we did that we if anyone wants to see. 
4. Writing the professionalism paper tonight. Get that turned in and have a good weekend.
